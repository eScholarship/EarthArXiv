# EarthArXiv
Project repository for EarthArXiv Preprints, powered by Janeway and CDL

This repository exists to help organize the work of migrating the [EarthArXiv](https://eartharxiv.org/) preprint service for the Earth sciences from OSF Preprints to a CDL-hosted preprint service based on Janeway.

## Integration with Janeway

* [preprint-remodel branch](https://github.com/BirkbeckCTP/janeway/tree/preprint-remodel) should match what is in production right now.
* [install EZID plugin](plugins/ezid/README.md) from this repository
* install python management commands from this repository (forthcoming)
